                     O People,

                     Listen attentively, for I do not know whether I will be with you again after this year. Convey my words to those who are absent. Just as you regard this day, this month, and this city as sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Do not harm one another, for you will meet your Lord, and He will hold you accountable.

                     Allah has forbidden interest; all interest obligations are canceled, starting with those owed to my uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. Beware of Satan, for he has lost hope of leading you astray in big matters but will try in small ones.

                     O People,

                     You have rights over your women, and they have rights over you. Treat them with kindness, for they are your partners. Provide for them with goodness. Worship Allah, pray your five daily prayers, fast during Ramadan, give Zakat, and perform Hajj if able. 

                     All mankind is from Adam and Eve. No Arab is superior to a non-Arab, nor is a non-Arab superior to an Arab; no white is superior to a black, nor is a black superior to a white—except in piety and good deeds. Every Muslim is a brother to every other Muslim. Do not commit injustices.

                     After me, no prophet will come, and no new religion will be born. I leave behind the Quran and the Sunnah; if you adhere to them, you will never go astray. Be my witness, O Allah, that I have conveyed Your message.
